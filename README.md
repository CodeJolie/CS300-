Analysis and Design

Developer: Serenity Rogers

  The primary problem in this project was to develop a command-line application that assists academic advisors in managing and retrieving course information, specifically focusing on course prerequisites. The goal was to implement a data structure that would allow efficient storage, retrieval, and searching of course data.

  Initially, the problem was approached by choosing a suitable data structure for storing and searching through course information. After evaluating options, I selected a Hash Table due to its average-case constant time complexity for search operations, which is ideal for efficiently retrieving course details. The project involved reading course data from a file, storing it in the selected data structure, and implementing functionality to search for specific courses and their prerequisites.

  Several roadblocks arose during the project, including issues with file paths, data structure selection, and ensuring the correct implementation of searching mechanisms. One significant challenge was resolving semantic errors and issues related to file handling. These were overcome by carefully reviewing the code, consulting with resources, and revisiting the initial problem requirements to ensure alignment with the project's goals.

  This project expanded my approach to software design by emphasizing the importance of choosing the correct data structure for the task. It reinforced the idea that understanding the underlying data structure's performance characteristics is crucial for efficient program design. It also highlighted the need to structure code in a way that is modular, allowing for easier debugging and future enhancements.

  Throughout this project, my approach to writing code has evolved significantly. I've gained a deeper appreciation for organizing code into functions and classes, making the program more modular and easier to maintain. Additionally, the emphasis on readability—such as using meaningful variable names, commenting, and adhering to consistent formatting—has made the codebase more accessible for future developers. Lastly, understanding the importance of adaptability has influenced me to write code that can be easily extended or modified to meet new requirements without significant rework.
